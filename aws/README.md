# QAQC AWS CloudFormation Stack

This directory contains code for creating CloudFormation stack to spin up all the various components for QAQC Dashboard. It is currently in **DEVELOPMENT**. The idea is that this app is self contained from the workers for the plots pipelines to the s3 bucket and CDN to serve the dashboard site.

**NOTE: None of the code currently works and need a lot of work still as of Dec 1st, 2022!**
